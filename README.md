# Replication Package: Federated SVM for Security Requirements Classification

This replication package contains the full implementation to reproduce results for a study on centralized and federated learning using SVMs for classifying security vs non-security software requirements.

************How to Run Experiments************

Step 1: Install Requirements
This project uses standard Python libraries. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

Step 2: Prepare Dataset

Place your dataset file named `seqreq.csv` inside the `dataset/` folder.  
Ensure it has at least the following two columns:

- `RequirementText`: the textual software requirement
- `Label`: either `Security` or `Non-Security`

Step 3: Run the Main Experiment

Navigate to the root directory and run the main script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

---

************Outputs************

After running, results will be saved to:
```
results/federated_svm_results.csv
```

This includes performance metrics for:
- Centralized SVM
- Federated SVM with IID data split
- Federated SVM with non-IID data split
